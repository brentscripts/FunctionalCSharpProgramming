# Practice Functional C# Programming with LINQPad

Welcome to my repository, where I engage in functional programming with C# by tackling algorithmic challenges using LINQPad. I leverage LINQ and functional programming concepts to enhance my skills.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find LINQPad files containing my solutions to various algorithm challenges.  Some of the functional programming principles applied are inspired by teachings in the book "Functional Programming with C# by Simon J. Painter"."

## Challenges

The challenges cover a range of topics, from array manipulation to string algorithms and more. Each LINQPad file corresponds to a specific challenge, providing both the problem and my solution.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open LINQPad and load the specific LINQPad file for the challenge you're interested in.
3. Explore the problem and my code solution.

## Challenges Credits

Many of the challenges are sourced from Code Wars. Check out [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com) for more algorithmic challenges and to sharpen your coding skills.

Happy Coding!
