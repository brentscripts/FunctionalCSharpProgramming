# Code Wars Challenges with LINQPad

Welcome to my repository where I tackle algorithm challenges from Code Wars using LINQPad, leveraging LINQ, functional programming concepts, and techniques from the book "Functional Programming with C# by Simon J. Painter."

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find LINQPad files containing solutions to various algorithm challenges sourced from Code Wars. I apply functional programming principles, inspired by the teachings in the book "Functional Programming with C#."

## Challenges

The challenges cover a range of topics, from array manipulation to string algorithms and more. Each LINQPad file corresponds to a specific challenge, providing both the problem statement and my solution.

## Functional Programming Techniques

I incorporate functional programming techniques from the book "Functional Programming with C# by Simon J. Painter" into my solutions. This book serves as a valuable resource for enhancing my coding skills.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open LINQPad and load the specific LINQPad file for the challenge you're interested in.
3. Explore the problem, input, and my solution using LINQ, functional programming, and techniques from the book.

## Challenges Credits

All challenges are sourced from Code Wars. Check out [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com) for more algorithmic challenges and to sharpen your coding skills.

Happy Coding!
